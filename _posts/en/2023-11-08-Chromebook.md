title: Not a good idea to use Chromebook in China

I just want to write something using my light weight Chromebook elegantly. But it let me down again.  

## Broken Linux Container

It's the second time I got this NEED_UPDATE error this year. 

I didn't make backup last time. I thought I could restore the backup and everything will be fine.

But I was wasting 10 minutes to see the restore progress bar stucked in 0%.

Alright, let's reboot and try again. Ok, after reboot it told me unable to restore the backup due to SOMETHING WRONG. 

I removed the whole Linux container and reinstalled it, which was the solution I took for the same issue 9 months ago.

But the installation was not smoothly. It will fail if the network proxy is not right.

## Unstable Network Connection

As a Chinese, we always need a proxy to reach the global internet.

But I cannot just use the same solution copied from Android to Chrombook.

I tried using 3 different network provided by different companies, only 1 can provide stable network. 

You also need to check the system time. One time I couldn't visit internet just because the system time cannot be sycnhronized successfully.

It's really very difficult to visit internet using Chromebook in China.

## Special User Habits

It's ok for frontend developer to use Chromebook for development using the Linux container feature since we can find the installation package of VSCode for Debian.

But if you need to operate the database, you may need to use command line directly because there are very few visualized tools for database in the Google Play and the Chrome web store. 

What's more, the keymaps in Chromebook are not the same as in most of other laptops. You'd better get used to it.

## Rare Accessories

Google is my dream company. I love the "G" in the cover.

I really wanted to take care of my Chromebook when I bought it. But I was not able to buy a suitable laptop case and screen protector and keyboard membrane in Chinese e-shop platforms Taobao and JD.

I'm a big Google fan but it's a pity that Google doesn't provide service to China.

I was as interested in ChromeOS as I'm interested in Android. But it's not a good idea to use it in my region.

At the time I finished this blog using Github web, I haven't finished reinstalling the Linux container. Who knows when will I get the same issue again ?
