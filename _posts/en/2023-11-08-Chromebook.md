title: Not a good idea to use Chromebook in China

I just wanted to write something using my light weight Chromebook. But it made me down again.

## Broken Linux Container

This is the second time I got this NEED_UPDATE error this year.

Last time I didn't make backup. I thought if I could restore from a backup then everything will be fine.

But I was wrong. I wasted 10 minutes in waiting for the restore progress bar which was stucked in 0%.

After reboot, I tried again. Then it told me it was unable to restore the backup due to SOMETHING WRONG.

Same as 9 months ago, I finally decided to remove the whole Linux container and reinstall it.

But the installation was not smoothly. It failed when something wrong happened in the network proxy.

## Unstable Network Connection

As a Chinese, I always need a proxy to reach the global internet.

But I cannot just use the same solution copied from Android to Chrombook.

I tried using 3 different network providers, only 1 is stable. 

What's more, you need to check the synchronization of system time because sycnhronization failure will cause network error.

It's really not easy to visit internet using Chromebook in China.

## Special User Habits

If you are a frontend developer, then using Chrombook for development is tolerable.

The Linux container feature fits NPM. And we can find the installation package of VSCode for Debian.

But if you need to communicate with database, you may need to use command line directly because there're very few graphical tools for database maangemetn in Google Play and Chrome web store.

The keymaps in Chromebook are not the same as in most of other laptops. You'd better get used to it.

## Rare Accessories

Google is my dream company. I really love the "G" in the cover.

But I was not able to buy a suitable laptop case, screen protector and keyboard membrane in Chinese e-shop platforms like Taobao and JD for it.

Even though I know Google doesn't provide service in China and possibly has no plan in the future, I'm a still a big fan of Android, Pixel, Chrome and ChromeOS.

But to be honest, it's really not a good idea to use it in this region.

By the time I finished this blog using Github web, the progress bar for Linux container installation is still running. Who knows when will I get the same issue again ?
