I just wanted to write something using my lightweight Chromebook. But it made me down again.

## Broken Linux Container

This is the second time I got this NEED_UPDATE error this year.

Last time I didn't make a backup. I thought if I could restore from a backup then everything would be fine.

But I was wrong. I wasted 10 minutes waiting for the restore progress bar which was stuck at 0%.

After rebooting, I tried again. Then it told me it was unable to restore the backup due to SOMETHING WRONG.

Same as 9 months ago, I finally decided to remove the whole Linux container and reinstall it.

But the installation was not smooth. It failed when something wrong happened in the network proxy.

## Unstable Network Connection

As a Chinese, I always need a proxy to reach the global internet.

But I cannot just use the same solution copied from Android to Chromebook.

I tried using 3 different network providers, and only 1 is stable. 

What's more, you need to check the synchronization of system time because synchronization failure will cause network error.

It's not really easy to visit the internet using a Chromebook in China.

## Special User Habits

If you are a front-end developer, then using a Chromebook for development is tolerable.

The Linux container feature fits NPM. And we can find the installation package of VSCode for Debian.

But if you need to communicate with a database, you may need to use the command line directly because there are very few graphical tools for database management in Google Play and Chrome web store.

The keymaps in Chromebook are not the same as in most other laptops. You'd better get used to it.

## Rare Accessories

Google is my dream company. I really love the "G" on the cover.

However, I was not able to buy a suitable laptop case, screen protector or keyboard membrane in Chinese e-shop platforms like Taobao and JD for it.

Even though I know Google doesn't provide service in China and possibly has no plan for the future, I'm still a big fan of Android, Pixel, Chrome and ChromeOS.

But to be honest, it's really not a good idea to use it in this region.

By the time I finished this blog using Github web, the progress bar for Linux container installation was still running. Who knows when will I get the same issue again ?
