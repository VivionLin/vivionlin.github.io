A week ago, I explored in the music app and was attracted by a song *All At Once*. The lyrics and arrangement are 'old-fashioned' but the singing touched me.

So I searched and found that it was sang by Whitney Houston. This brought my memories to the summer when I was a medium school student and got my first eletrical device which is a MP3.
There were few songs in it and one of them is *I Will Always Love You*. I still remember the first time I listened to this song, I was astonished by the long breath and vocal techniques of the singer.
I was like 'Oww, this woman is the professional, I am just a normal people who can make sounds'..

Whitney's singing always impresses me. Her life stories hit me too.

I became a high school student when she passed away. I heard she had a toxic relationship and she was addicted to drugs.
I thought it's a pity that she had such a gifted voice, but lost her voice because of unhealthy habits and not able to rise again and died young.

Nobody can sing *I Will Always Love You* better than her. I've listened to many versions of different singers, she is the best.
But we are not able to see that peek performance again. The death marks an end to this legend.

This feeling of pity drives me to know more about her stories. So I watched Whitney's talk with Oprah, the book wrote by Robyn Crawford, the Tyler Henry and Bobby Brown episode..
As I read more and more, I realized that the reason why I was so attracted by her stories is because I want to figure out why she has so much but still cannot lead a 'good' life.

She was beautiful, talented, world-famous, and can earn a lot of money even after passing. But she was also stressful and cannot be herself because the medio and people were finding topics about her private life.
I don't know if drugs to her was a way to run away from her painful life. But the fortune and fame didn't bring her happiness and peace. She still had a lot of issues to deal with.

I eagerly want to be rich these months. I always imagine to live in my own house with my love one in an ideal place, have more time to keep healthy and focus on my hobbies, no need to worry about lossing financial income because of being myself..
I thought if I could be rich, these would all be solved, and I could find happiness.
I was anxious and dreamed a lot. These are my issues.

If Whitney could find a therapist, or listen to some authentic advices from her close friends, she might can go out earlier.
But even though we thought her marriage was painful, she still found happiness in it and had no regret about that.

I feel more satisfied with my life now. I do have a lot. My life is not perfect, but I still can find happiness in every aspects of my life. 
No matter we are rich or poor, talented or normal, having healthy habits or not, we all have our own troubles, and our own treasures.

Thanks to Witney, I wish you find your god and the unconditional love and the strength in heaven to enter the next stage of your expriences.
