## A Roam fan

In 2020, I occasionally found a note-taking product named **Roam Research**.

I was surprised by the idea of <mark>bi-directional links</mark> and thought this was a revolutionary feature.

Most of the popular products (Evernote, Notion, Youdao note, etc.) at that time were tree-like (folder->subfolder/note, 1 to N),
but the bi-directional links in Roam can make notes more like a graph (notes <-> notes, N to M).

This makes sense as the neurons in our brains are also structured like a network, a graph.

So, I couldn't wait to pay to subscribe to Roam Research just to experience and support it :open_hands:.


## Poor in visualization

I migrated and recorded my todo list, journals, thoughts in Roam.

As I spent 2 years in Roam, I found it lacking in mind maps.
When the relationships between notes are complex, mind maps can provide a more readable view. So I had to use XMind or DrawIO for drawing, then export as pictures to embed in Roam.


## Try Heptabase

Then in 2022, I heard a new product named Heptabase from a Roam fans club.

This product also has some revolutionary ideas, focusing on the <mark>entire input-output flow</mark>:

* Record pieces of information in **journal**
* When you want to study a specific topic, pull out the info from the journal as a **card**
* If you want to define the relationships between cards, create a **whiteboard**
* Then you can easily write an article by copy-paste this whiteboard
* What's more, if you want to maintain a big picture of whiteboards, you can design them in a **map**

Sounds like it not only keeps the advantages of bi-directional links, but also provides help in building mind maps and outputting articles.

I think Heptabase can better match my professional knowledge management needs.

I just paid $83 to use&support it for a year.

My first project on it is GCP learning. Let me see if it's worth or not :laughing:!
